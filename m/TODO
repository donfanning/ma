TODO:

Immediate:
- terminal setup for mdial
- clean session termination: hook off, etc.
- carrier lost detection and reporting

Short term:
* m.c - store all global arrays (dp,dp_names,drivers) and initializations
  - started, to continue
* tty data processing
  - modem_tty_process() - use rx, tx data fifos
  - get_char, put_char callbacks
  - trivial command/data/connected state handling
  - integration with async bitqueue
* prepare to release
  - README
  - rebuild source tree: all on top, tools sub-directory
  	(for gen_tables, filters, octave stuff, low-level testers)
  - trivial cleanups
* trivial detector dp
  - something done, may be extended to detection of multi-freq signals,
    signals with phase reversion (like ansam) and non-continues signals
    (like BUSY, DIALTONE, etc). Then may be integrated with dialer's
    dialtone detection.
* v22(bis)/psk/qam
  - psk demod optimization: x0,y0 may be saved for future use
    (sin,cos should run phase continually then)
  - psk mod optimization: split input (bits) to I and Q, filter
    separately (by RRC) with using prepared lookup-tables.
  - basic psk modulator
  - verify scrambler "invert after 64 ones" feature
  - tests, improvements
  - qam demodulator/modulator
  - v22bis protocol
* hdlc data layer, error corrector
* trivial at processor

To improve:
* command line processor
  - two pass processing (verify + process)
  - multiple input tables (per application)
  - better table format
* async bitqueue improvements:
  - handle different char formats: 8N1, 7E1, etc,
  - break handing (add ->break_count)
* debug module
  - cleanups
  - possible debug.c -> logging.c rename, separate .h
* fsk, v21
  - cleanup

Long term:
* compressor
* at processor
* v34
* v90
